GAME JOURNAL

-1/25/23-
    I am trying to think of a simple game to make this week but I don't really know any Processing so I don't know what I can do yet. Maybe some kind of solo pong game or something that is easy enough to animate. My only animation experience is Python Turtle so I need to figure out where to start.
